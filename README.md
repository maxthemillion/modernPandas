# Modern Pandas
While writing pandas pipelines for reading and preparing data, I often ask my self, if there is a more pythonic or more pandas way to do things. So I set out to search the web and found a series of blogposts called [Modern Pandas by Tom Augspurger](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1-intro.html). This repository contains pipeline steps that I often write and compares different solutions for these regarding clarity and speed.
